title: How I Perform Interviews
---

## Story Time

The first time I was asked to conduct an interview, I was very green, fresh out of school, and I was sure it was an accident to be on the list. But no, boss confirmed it, and I was on may into a 30-minute, one-on-one, me and the candidate interview. Needless to say, I was bit scared of the prospect of being on the other side of the table for the first time.

It went okay. I channeled everything I had experienced hitting the interview circuit after college and got by. I was asked to interview a more candidates in the next few months, and then got the opportunity to attend an interview training course. It changed a lot for me, and I still reference it to this day, 6+ years later. What follows is roughly what I learned and how I've adapted it over the years.

*Note: I primarily interview candidates for engineering positions, so most of the process is with that slant. However, it can be adapted for any type of candidate.*

## The Overarching Drive

What really resonated with me from the training, was the idea of treating the interview as an evaluation process for both parties involved. It's not a time for the candidate to jump through hoops or prove their worthiness. Both parities should be able to assess how they fit with the other.

* **Company**: Is this candidate the right fit for the position and our culture?
* **Candidate**: Is this position and company the right fit for me and my career?

My responsibility as the interviewer is to make sure I can do my part for the company, but also provide information to the candidate to help with their decision (by telling them company info and providing the opportunity for questions).

## It's My Process and It Works for Me

1. 15-minute resume review and interview planning
1. Chat with others participating in the interview and company stakeholders
1. Perform the interview
  1. Introductions/formalities
  1. General technical questions
  1. Specific to position technical questions
  1. Solicit candidate questions
  1. Wrap-up
1. Form personal opinions and thoughts
1. Chat with others involved

## The Helpfulness of Fifteen Minutes of Planning

First thing I like to do is a quick read of the candidate's resume. Looking for keywords and discussion directly related to the position we're trying to fill. I look for anything that makes the candidate stand out (good or bad). I try to gauge where they are in their career, if they're a newbie, middle, or senior. I then make notes of anything that looks suspicious or needs more clarification so I can ask the candidate directly.

> A structured interview beats one by the seat of your pants.

Next, I'll make a quick outline that will serve as my road map for the interview. Even the stuff I do every time in the introduction, I'll write down just to keep everything structured. In the road map, I'll jot down the rough questions I'm going to ask along with space to write their answers. Pretty much, every time, I'll copy the outline in the previous section, fluff it out for the specific candidate, and be good to go.

## Interview Huddle

If there are multiple people interviewing a candidate, it's important to me that we don't repeat ourselves and look like a bunch of idiots. Hopefully, there is a process in place for everyone to convene prior to the interview, but if not, I'll go chat with everyone myself just to see what other people are thinking. Additionally, if there is someone I think should have a say in the candidate but they aren't on that schedule, I'll chat with them about the candidate and see if they have any questions I can ask on their behalf.

## Let's Do This!

Game time! With road map in hand, running through the interview is pretty straightforward assuming the candidate doesn't throw you any curve balls.

### Introductions

I always open by asking if they'd like water, need to use the restroom, etc. Afterwards, I'll provide basic information about myself, my background, how long I've been with the company, etc. Afterwards, let the candidate introduce themselves. I usually open the floor by asking them to provide a 5-minute elevator pitch about themselves. Afterwards, if there are any issues from their resume, I'll bring them up here.

### Light Tech Questions

Open with something that they should know, something off their resume for example. It doesn't have to be hugely technical. My intent with the first question is to allow the candidate to get an easy answer under their belt right out of the gate. If it's a younger candidate, I may ask one or two more to help calm their nerves.

After this I'll ask "light" technical questions based on their experience. This is the time I ask language quirk questions, seek technical details about their background, and what not. If the candidate struggles anytime through these, it sends up red flags. These should be questions they have no trouble answering. I'll save the hard ones for round two.

### Work the Body, Work the Body

After the first round, depending on how they're doing, I'll start turning up the difficulty of my questions. I'll ask more design/cerebral oriented and less trivia questions. These are questions that don't always have correct answers, especially the design ones. This is where the great candidates separate themselves from the good ones. I have a toolbox of questions to pull from, but if time permits, I'll try and put one together that fits the candidate. Lastly, if I'm going to have the candidate code at all, this is where it'll happen.

### Their Turn and Finishing

Once I'm satisfied, I'll open the floor to the candidate. Let them ask any questions they like about any topic. If they're a little slow, I'll prompt them by saying things like: "Anything you want to know about our culture? Or day-to-day?", etc., etc. The good candidates won't always need prompting, but I find it doesn't hurt.

It's during this time I also try and sell the company. Especially if I really like the candidate. If I already feel the candidate is a good fit, I take it on myself to try and show how the company is a good fit for them. Anything I think will be important for them to know, I'll try and work into the conversation.

Once we're all good. Do the usual thank yous and goodbyes and end the interview.

## Sooooooo, whaddya think?

Usually before the interview is done, I've already determined if I'm going to recommend them for hire or not. Even if I think I have, I find it's best to take a few moments to myself and confirm my initial/gut thoughts before being influenced by other interviewers. Note, I'm not setting this decision in stone, just making sure I have a set position before I start the conversation with my coworkers. I also want to try a solidify an concerns about the candidate.

## The Final Countdown

The end is finally here. If you can, talk it over with the others and make sure everyone has a similar opinion. When there is a conflict, try and figure out how people came to their conclusions. This is where it comes in handy to take a few moments to yourself prior to solidify your own thoughts. Also, make sure to voice any concerns in case someone else got a different vibe or asked a more targeted question that could address it.

Finally, when it comes time to make a decision. It's not a yes, no, or maybe. It's a no or a yes. Try your hardest to always think of it in those terms, because at the end of the day, you either make them an offer or not, you don't maybe offer them a job.
